# scaling-platformer-engine-unfinished
A size-scaling platformer engine made for Unity.  
This project is unfinished.  (and is not going to be finished)

Originally made for the [Game Off 2023](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) but was never finished.  

The main feature is a platformer engine that allows the scaling of **any** scale-physics object in the game.  
This includes the player.
The player's jump height, mass, and view distance change with the player size.  
Finally, there is a somewhat glitchy spring that responds to the size of scale-physics objects.

The art in the game is not mine. It is from [this](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/pixel-adventure-1-155360) Unity extention

I'm pretty satisfied with how the engine came out.  
I may try to make it again in Godot.  

You are free to use this code in your Unity games.  

If you do want to use this, please let me know where you're using this  
either by forking the repository or opening an issue.  
I would love to see the exciting things you do with this. :)
