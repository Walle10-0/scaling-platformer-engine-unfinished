Basically... do whatever you want with my code in this repository.
I created the scripts in the './Assets/scripts' folder.

Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or
distribute the parts of this software that I created, (in ./Assets/scripts)
either in source code form or as a compiled binary,
for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

All I ask is that you consider letting me know where you're using it
as I would love to see the cool things you create with it
